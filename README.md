Hacked together a script to remove YT shorts from subscription feed.
Might not work all the time, so feel free to contribute.

Loading the extension:

## Firefox

- Download it from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/delete-shorts-from-yt-feed

---

## Chromium Browsers

- Go to `brave://extensions/` or `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable `Developer Mode`
- Click `Load Unpacked`
- Select this extension's folder.
- Ignore the manifest 2 error on load.
